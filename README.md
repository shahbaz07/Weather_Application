# Weather_Application
Show the weather of any city. I am using open API for weather. Link for open API is "http://api.openweathermap.org".

There are three types of cache. You can change the cache just passing differnet type in WeatherImplFactory.getWeatherManager.
You can also change the cache timer by changing the value of Constants.WEATHER_INFO_CACHE_TIME. Default value is 60000 in millisecond.
